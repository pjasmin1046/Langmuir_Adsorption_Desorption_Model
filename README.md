    Conducts a Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (KMC) of gas adsorption/desorption on a 2D lattice of a hypothetical substrate. 
    Rate constants and the effect of near-neighbor interactions can be manipulated, and graphical output of % surface coverage and the probability of each possible event over time is provided at the end of each simulation.
    Assumptions and design considerations are commented within the model.
